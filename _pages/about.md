I'm currently a Postdoc at University of Notre Dame, working with Prof. Jian-Xun Wang. I also work at ND-ECI, funded by ND-ECI, ND-Energy and CCI Postdoctoral Fellowships. My research interest is Fluid-structures interactions and turbulence. 
At present, my efforts are dedicated to a groundbreaking project centered on the development of a novel hybrid differentiable neural solver. This solver is meticulously crafted to enable the efficient simulation of wall-bounded turbulence. One of the cornerstones of this project involves the creation of a fully-differentiable Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solver utilizing the JAX framework. This solver, designed to simulate Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) and turbulence, is poised to be released as an open-source resource in the near future.
An integral aspect of my work involves the integration of various cutting-edge deep learning techniques into this solver. By synergizing these techniques, I aspire to enhance simulations in terms of both speed and accuracy, thereby pushing the boundaries of what is achievable in fluid dynamics research. 
<!-- If you share an interest in fluid-structure interactions, turbulence, and the fusion of deep learning and computational fluid dynamics, I am eager to explore opportunities for collaboration and knowledge exchange. Feel free to reach outâ€”I am excited about the potential for impactful collaborations. -->
