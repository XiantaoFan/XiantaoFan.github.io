I'm currently a Postdoc at University of Notre Dame, working with Prof. Jian-Xun Wang. I also work at ND-ECI, funded by ND-ECI, ND-Energy and CCI Postdoctoral Fellowships. My research interest is Fluid-structures interactions and turbulence. 

\\

My research interests lie at fluid-structure interactions (FSI) and turbulence, with a focus on bridging fundamental principles of fluid dynamics and structural dynamics to practical engineering applications. I am dedicated to creating computational frameworks that seamlessly integrate numerical methods with innovative machine learning (ML) techniques. My primary objectives are elucidating the underlying physics of complex turbulent flows and nonlinear structural dynamics, as well as their interactive effects using computational approach. To this end, I'm actively developing a GPU differentiable CFD solver (Diff-FlowFSI) based on JAX, and establishing hybrid neural models to enhance the simulation of FSI and turbulence.



<!-- At present, my efforts are dedicated to a groundbreaking project centered on the development of a novel hybrid differentiable neural solver. This solver is meticulously crafted to enable the efficient simulation of wall-bounded turbulence. One of the cornerstones of this project involves the creation of a fully-differentiable Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solver utilizing the JAX framework. This solver, designed to simulate Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) and turbulence, is poised to be released as an open-source resource in the near future.
An integral aspect of my work involves the integration of various cutting-edge deep learning techniques into this solver. By synergizing these techniques, I aspire to enhance simulations in terms of both speed and accuracy, thereby pushing the boundaries of what is achievable in fluid dynamics research.  -->
<!-- If you share an interest in fluid-structure interactions, turbulence, and the fusion of deep learning and computational fluid dynamics, I am eager to explore opportunities for collaboration and knowledge exchange. Feel free to reach outâ€”I am excited about the potential for impactful collaborations. -->
